This is the user-specific data directory for ASCIIpOrtal.

It is used to store save data for each map pack, in Yaml format.
You might also want to provide custom mappacks; just put your maps under
a <map_pack_name> subdirectory, and make sure your maps are named properly
('001.txt', '002.txt', ...)

Keep in mind that this directory is searched first; if you provide maps
under a mappack name that already exists (e.g. 'default/'), they'll get used
instead of the official ones.
